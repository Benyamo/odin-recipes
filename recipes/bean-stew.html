        <h3>Description</h3>    

        <p>Use a can of mixed beans to make this tomato-based veggie stew with halloumi. Make it in just 25 minutes for a quick and easy midweek supper.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 red pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>3 tbsp red chilli pesto, sundried tomato pesto or vegan alternative</li>
            <li>1 heaped tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>400g can mixed beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ x 250g block halloumi, sliced</li>
            <li>½ small bunch of coriander, finely chopped</li>
            <li>garlic bread, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and pepper, along with a pinch of salt and fry for 10 mins or until softened. Add the garlic, pesto and ground coriander, and cook for 1 min. Tip in the beans and tomatoes along with ½ can of water, then bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining oil to a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the halloumi for 2 mins on each side or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Taste the beans for seasoning, then spoon into deep bowls. Top with the halloumi and scatter over the chopped coriander. Serve with garlic bread, if you like.</li>
