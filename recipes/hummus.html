        <p class="description">Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.</p>

        <p class="description">This creamy, rich vegan hummus is made using just five ingredients and is ready in 10 minutes. Serve with crunchy seasonal veg or warm pitta breads.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 can chickpeas, drained</li>
            <li>60ml cold water, plus a 30ml for a looser consistency</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove peeled and crushed</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced then ½ zested</li>
            <li>3 tbsp tahini</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, to garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>mixed crudités and toasted pitta bread, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly rinse the chickpeas in a colander under cold running water. Tip into the large bowl of a food processor along with 60ml of water and blitz until almost smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, lemon and tahini, and blitz again. If the consistency is too thick, gradually pour in up to 30ml more water. Blitz again for about 5 mins, or until the hummus is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Season with a good pinch of sea salt and transfer to a bowl. Swirl the top of the hummus with the back of a dessert spoon and drizzle over a little olive oil. Serve with crunchy crudités and toasted pitta bread, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
